The report consists of three volumes, as follows Volume I Concept and Definitions of Software Quality, Volume II Metric Data Collection and Validation, Volume III preliminary Handbook on Software Quality for an, Acquisition Manager. The objective of the study was to establish a concept of software quality and provide an Air Force acquisition manager with a mechanism to quantitatively specify and measure the desired level of quality in a software product. Software metrics provide the mechanism for the quantitative specification and measurement of quality. This first volume describes the process of developing our concepts of software quality and what the underlying software attributes are that provide the quality, and defines the metrics which provide a measure of the degree to which the attributes exist.},
