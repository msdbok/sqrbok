# Quality Dimensions by David A. Garvin
David A. Garvin {% cite garvin_what_1984 %}describes eight dimensions of quality that can be used to evaluate a product. These dimensions provide a framework for understanding the various aspects of what makes a product "good" and can help companies to strategically focus on particular elements of quality.

*   **Performance:** This refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. It involves measurable attributes and is often ranked on a scale. For instance, the acceleration of a car or the sound and picture quality of a television would fall under performance.
*   **Features:** These are the secondary characteristics of a product that supplement its basic functions. Features often differentiate one product from another in the same category.
*   **Reliability:** This refers to the probability of a product not failing within a specified time period. It is often measured by metrics like the mean time to first failure (MTTF) and the failure rate per unit time.
*   **Conformance:** This dimension measures the degree to which a product's design and operating characteristics match pre-established standards. It involves both internal (e.g., manufacturing processes) and external elements (e.g., design specifications).
*  **Durability:** This is a measure of the economic and technical life of a product. Technically, it can be defined as how long a product is useful before it deteriorates. It has both economic and technical dimensions.
*   **Serviceability:** This dimension focuses on the speed, courtesy, and competence of repair. It also includes the ease of product repair.
*   **Aesthetics:** This is a subjective dimension relating to how a product looks, feels, sounds, tastes, or smells. It is highly dependent on individual preferences.
*   **Perceived Quality:** This refers to a customerâ€™s subjective assessment of a product's quality. It is often based on indirect measures, such as a brand's reputation or name.

It is important to note that these dimensions are not always independent of each other. For example, performance and features are often closely related. While some dimensions like reliability and conformance can be measured objectively, others, such as aesthetics, are more subjective. Companies can strategically prioritize different dimensions based on their products and market strategy.

The relative importance of each dimension varies according to different consumer needs. For example, the dimensions of quality that are important for a piano may differ greatly from the dimensions that are important for an automobile. Furthermore, it is difficult to improve all dimensions of quality simultaneously, as there are trade-offs that must be made. Therefore, businesses often need to focus on specific quality dimensions to gain a competitive advantage.
